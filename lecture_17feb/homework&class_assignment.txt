
1. wap to accept 2 lists from user and find union of them
2. wap to accept 2 lists from user and find intersection of them
3. symmetric difference (except common elements)
4. wap to chk if 
	1. list2 is subset of list1
	2. disjoint
	3. superset


eg..

[1, 7, 11, 15, 21, 50]
[2, 7, 15, 17]

union = [1, 7, 11, 15, 21, 50, 2, 17]
intersection = [7, 15]
symmetric difference = [1,2,11,17,21,50]

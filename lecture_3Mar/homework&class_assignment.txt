HW ::
4. wap to accept a filename from user and print those lines which have 'the' word more than once (hint : dictionary split ) (make generic)
5. wap to accept a filename from user and print it in reverse order. (no lines to be repeated, no readlines, read functions, no list,)
    (hint: recursive)
6. wap to accept a configuration file from user and create a dictionary of configurations defined in it. (if line starting with comment ignore the line or if line contains comment in between then also ignore)
7. wap to accept a filename from user and print alternate 10 chars from it (hint: use read, seek functions)
    (seek accept 2 params - 0 start, 1 current, 2 end--reverse)
    (first read then)
    (
        >>> fd  = open("read_file_line.py")
        >>> fd.seek(10,0)
        10
        >>> fd.read(10)
        ' to accept'
    )
    ( for opening file in 3.x :::: import io ----then----  io.FileIO(filename))

**** Think about,what steps system must be taking when we call fd.open() ****

1. WAP to accept entered number even or odd without using arithmetic operator.

2. wap to accept a string from user and print count of consonents from string

3. WAP to accpet a number from user and a bit position to turn-off from the given number.. print number after turning off the bit in decimal.. (eg. 16 (bit pos : 5) ==> 0)


Homework ::::
1. draw mindmap diagram for functions...
2. wap to accept a number from user and chk if it is divisible by 8 without using arithmetic operators.. (hint: write binaries of divisible by 8 and chk if it follows same pattern)
3. wap to accept  a number from user and number of bits to turn on from given pos
4. wap to accept a string which has repetative characters consecutively and optimize the storage space for the same..
 eg.  aaabbcccccddddddaaa =>> o/p -> a3b2c5d6a3
5.
